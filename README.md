# Hash-Maps

[Javascript - Hash Map Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)

The purpose of this project was to build a Hash Map class in Javascript. This was a recent addition to the The Odin Project's Javascript course. The HashMap class was to include the following functions:

- `hash(key)` to generate the hash code from the key.
- `set(key, value)` to add the key, value pair into the hash map.
- `get(key)` returns the value that is assigned to this key.
- `has(key)` returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- `remove(key)` removes the entry with the associated key and returns true. Returns false if the key is not found.
- `length()` returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- `clear()` removes all entries from the hash map.
- `keys()` returns an array containing all the keys in the hash map.
- `values()` returns an array containing all the values in the hash map.
- `entries()` returns an array containing all the [key, value] pairs in the hash map.

## Built With

Typescript

## Lessons Learned

This project was another opportunity to strengthen my experience with the Full Stack process. On the client side, this was a great opportunity to go more in depth with asynchronous REST API calls, using React hooks, and how to manipulate the DOM to flesh out the user interactions for the game. This was also another opportunity to really get to know Typescript. I learned a lot about setting up types building the game from the ground up.
