# Hash-Maps

[Javascript - Hash Map Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)

The purpose of this project was to build a Hash Map class in Javascript. This was a recent addition to the The Odin Project's Javascript course. The HashMap class was to include the following functions:

- `hash(key)` to generate the hash code from the key.
- `set(key, value)` to add the key, value pair into the hash map.
- `get(key)` returns the value that is assigned to this key.
- `has(key)` returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- `remove(key)` removes the entry with the associated key and returns true. Returns false if the key is not found.
- `length()` returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- `clear()` removes all entries from the hash map.
- `keys()` returns an array containing all the keys in the hash map.
- `values()` returns an array containing all the values in the hash map.
- `entries()` returns an array containing all the [key, value] pairs in the hash map.

## Built With

Typescript

## Lessons Learned

I learned how hash maps work! Most languages have hash maps built in, but it was cool to see how it works under the hood. I was initially intimidated by hash maps, but implementing one in TS/JS provided some clarity.
